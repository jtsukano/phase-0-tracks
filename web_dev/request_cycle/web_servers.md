    A VPS is a server that is hosted by one hardware, but allows for private software usage of the server so that the server you are hosting on isn't being shared with others and you have full access to the memory and capacity of it. The advantages are that you have more stability since you don't have to share with others, and you have more control over the server since you have root access to it. You are able to also scale easily since the servers are hosted within a container that allows for easy customization of capacity when needed. Finally, they are more cost effective.

    Running a program under root user opens potential incidents of altering the main components of the OS since you'll have full access to the files.
