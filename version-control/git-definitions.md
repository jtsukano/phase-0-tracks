# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    *Version control is being able to change files while having the ability to go back to specific previous versions. This allows you go go back to a previous working version if a new version had new errors or compare how previous versions worked in general to the latest ones. It helps minimize the level of error and time to fix it late into the project.*
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    *A branch is a separate repo you create to work on the file without actually changing the original copy. It's useful so that you don't end up changing something accidentally and allows you to compare it to the original version.* 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    *To commit is to upload the changes you made to a file into the sourse repository. A good commit message will include what was changed, added, or deleted from the previous version.*
* What is a merge conflict?
    *Merge conflict is when the branch you work on and the branch you want to merge with has diverged.*
